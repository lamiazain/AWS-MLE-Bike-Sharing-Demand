# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### Lamiaa Hassan Mohammed Zain

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: Predictions needed to be greater than or equal to 0. That’s why clipping the predictions to have the lower boundary of zero was done. Also rounding the target ‘count’ 

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: WeightedEnsemble_L3 
 

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: 
* It was found that people rented pikes more from Jan to Feb 2011 and from Sep to Oct 2012. People tend to rent more during the following hours (1-2.5 am, 7-9 am, 1-4 pm, 9-11 pm).
* There was a strong correlation between Season and month, hence the season column was dropped from the training and testing datasets.
* Features like the weather were categorized.
### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: From public score of 1.8, it was improved to be 0.57651. 
* This was mainly because of the drop of the correlated column and 
* because of the better representation of the datetime column where new features of hour, month and day were used and datetime column was dropped.

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: It was slightly improved from 0.57651 to 0.55532 as appeared in Kaggle public score.

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: I would do data normalization and more feature engineering with EDA.

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.

## Summary
TODO: 
In this project, we have obtained/explored following steps in the ML Lifecycle.

* Problem: Better utilization of the data generated by the systems in the bike sharing industry as well as exogenous information are keys to take business advantages for firms.

* Business Objective: Predict bike sharing demand provided data related to different factors provided.

* Obtain Data Data is obtained from the "Bike Sharing Demand" kaggle competition.

* Analyze Data Data is described, visualized and modified mainly using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seabon library.

* Build Model Built models using Autogluon AutomML library. Initially created model without any preprocessing. Later, built models creating new features and tuning hyper parameters.

* Test Model Models are tested by submitting the predictions to Kaggle and compared the models based on the scroe obtained.
